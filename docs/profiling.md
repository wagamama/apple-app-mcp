# Profiling

Mac Mail MCP ships a `--profile PATH` flag on `index` and `rebuild` so
you can capture a performance trace of the indexing pipeline and share
it in a bug report — or use it locally to diagnose slow syncs on your
own mailbox.

The flag uses Python's stdlib `cProfile`, so there are no extra runtime
dependencies. Profile dumps are standard `pstats`-format files readable
by any Python profiling tool.

## When to profile

- You're seeing slow `mac-mail-mcp index` or `rebuild` runs and want
  to know which layer is the bottleneck (disk walk vs `.emlx` parse vs
  HTML stripping vs SQLite inserts vs FTS5 rebuild).
- You're filing a perf-related issue and want to give maintainers
  actionable data instead of just "this is slow on a 100k mailbox."
- You're evaluating a code change for its real cost on your own
  workload, not against the project's benchmarks (which run on a
  smaller fixture).

If you just want to know *whether* the index is healthy — not how fast
it builds — use `mac-mail-mcp status` instead.

## Capture a profile

```bash
mac-mail-mcp index --profile /tmp/sync.prof
```

This runs the full disk-based index build wrapped in `cProfile`. The
`.prof` file is binary; it's a few MB even for a 100k+ mailbox.

The same flag works on `rebuild`:

```bash
mac-mail-mcp rebuild --profile /tmp/rebuild.prof
```

The flag adds measurable overhead (typically 5-10% of wall-clock for
the indexing operation), so don't leave it on for normal use.

## Inspect the profile

### Quick text summary

The simplest readout — sorted by where time was *actually spent*
(self-time, excluding callees):

```bash
python -c "
import pstats
p = pstats.Stats('/tmp/sync.prof')
p.sort_stats('tottime').print_stats(20)
"
```

For "where does time *flow* through the call stack" (cumulative time,
including callees):

```bash
python -c "
import pstats
p = pstats.Stats('/tmp/sync.prof')
p.sort_stats('cumulative').print_stats(25)
"
```

### Flame chart (visual)

[`flameprof`](https://github.com/baverman/flameprof) renders a
self-contained SVG that shows the full call-stack hierarchy with
box width proportional to time:

```bash
uv tool install flameprof   # one-time install
flameprof /tmp/sync.prof --width 1600 > /tmp/sync_flame.svg
open /tmp/sync_flame.svg
```

The flame chart has two halves stacked together:

- **Top half (orange/yellow): cumulative time.** Each box's width =
  total time spent in that function *and everything it called*.
  Vertical position = call stack depth (bottom = entry point, up =
  deeper in the stack). Read this to answer *where in the codebase
  does work flow*.
- **Bottom half (grayscale): self time.** Same call stack ordering, but
  width = time spent *inside* that function only, excluding callees.
  Wide bars here are the actual workers; narrow bars are scaffolding
  that just dispatches to children. Read this to answer *which
  function should I optimize*.

### Call graph (alternative)

[`gprof2dot`](https://github.com/jrfonseca/gprof2dot) renders a directed
graph where nodes are functions, edges are calls, and edge thickness is
time:

```bash
uv tool install gprof2dot
brew install graphviz   # for the `dot` renderer
python -m gprof2dot -f pstats /tmp/sync.prof --node-thres=1.0 \
    | dot -Tsvg -o /tmp/sync_callgraph.svg
open /tmp/sync_callgraph.svg
```

Better for "how is the codebase structured under load" than "where is
time going" — for the latter, prefer the flame chart.

### Interactive exploration (local only)

[`snakeviz`](https://jiffyclub.github.io/snakeviz/) opens an interactive
sunburst in your browser:

```bash
uv tool install snakeviz
snakeviz /tmp/sync.prof
```

Best for ad-hoc drill-down on your own machine; not useful for
attaching to bug reports because it's not a static asset.

## Sharing a profile in a bug report

The `.prof` file is small (a few MB even for large indexes) and
contains only function names, file paths from your installed Python
environment, and timing data. It does **not** contain message
content, email addresses, or filenames from your mailbox — only
references to internal Python functions like `email.parser.parse` or
`apple_mail_mcp.index.disk.parse_emlx`.

That said, the file paths in the dump *do* include your username
(e.g. `/Users/<you>/Library/Mail/V10/...` won't appear, but
`/Users/<you>/.local/share/uv/python/...` will). Strip your
username with `sed` before attaching if you'd rather not share it:

```bash
sed -i '' "s|/Users/$(whoami)|/Users/USER|g" /tmp/sync.prof
```

Then attach to the issue with a short note: mailbox size, machine
specs, wall-clock time, and the `pstats` text summary inline so
maintainers can read it without downloading the binary.

## Reading a profile: what to look for

The right question to ask is *which optimizations would change the
breakdown*, not just *what is the largest line*. Some patterns:

- **One function dominates self-time (>40%)**: the optimization target
  is clear — that function is the bottleneck. Look for ways to call it
  less often or replace its implementation.
- **No single function dominates; time is balanced across many small
  workers**: this is the "death by a thousand cuts" pattern. Per-line
  optimizations won't help much; the right move is structural — *do
  less work*, not *do work faster*. Skip a phase entirely, cache an
  expensive computation, or use a different algorithm.
- **A wide cumulative bar with thin self-time inside it**: a *router*
  function. Optimizing it directly buys nothing; push down into its
  children.
- **Time invariant with input size**: classic sign of unconditional
  work. If a sync with 1 changed message takes the same wall-clock as
  a sync with 1000 changed messages, the work is happening
  independent of the diff result. Look for code paths that run
  regardless of state (often: full re-walks, full re-parses).

## What this project knows so far

A reference profile of `mac-mail-mcp index` on a real ~60k-message
mailbox (M1 Pro, internal SSD, macOS 26.4):

![Reference flame chart from a 60k-message index run](img/profile_flame_example.png)

The chart's two halves answer different questions (top: cumulative time
through the call stack; bottom: self-time spent inside each function).
See "Flame chart (visual)" above for how to read each.

Aggregated by component:

| Component | Approximate share of self-time |
|---|---|
| Stdlib `email.parser` internals | ~20% |
| File I/O (`open`, `read`) | ~11% |
| SQLite `execute` calls | ~8% |
| Regex matching | ~7% |
| `pathlib` operations | ~5% |
| HTML stripping (`_strip_html`) | ~3% |
| Other Python overhead | ~46% |

There is no single dominant bottleneck on this dataset. The disk walk
itself (`scan_emlx_files`) is only ~10% of cumulative time — most of
the cost is in *parsing* what the walk surfaces, not in the walk.

Larger mailboxes (200k+) and attachment-heavy archives may show
different breakdowns. Profile your own data before assuming the
above generalizes.
