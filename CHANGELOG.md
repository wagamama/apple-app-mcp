# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.5.14] - 2026-07-15

### Fixed

- **Scheduled Calendar rebuilds retain EventKit authorization** — added
  `mac-calendar-mcp authorize`, which installs and signs a small helper app
  with a stable macOS privacy identity. EventKit snapshots use that compiled
  helper when available, so launchd rebuilds no longer inherit an anonymous
  command-line authorization state that can be add-events-only or
  undetermined. Snapshot values are passed as process arguments rather than
  interpolated into executable JavaScript.

### Changed

- Bumped both PyPI packages and MCP registry manifests to `0.5.14`.

## [0.5.13] - 2026-07-15

### Fixed

- **Calendar rebuilds use EventKit and preserve the last healthy index** —
  when Calendar's private SQLite store is unavailable, rebuilds now fetch a
  bounded occurrence snapshot through Apple's supported EventKit API before
  trying legacy Calendar.app scripting. Failed, partial, and unconfirmed empty
  snapshots are rejected before publication, and mid-replacement exceptions
  roll back instead of exposing an empty index. `rebuild --verbose` reports the
  source and raw snapshot counts. `APPLE_CALENDAR_INDEX_SOURCE` can force the
  `store`, `eventkit`, or legacy `jxa` path for diagnosis and verification.

### Changed

- Bumped both PyPI packages and MCP registry manifests to `0.5.13`.

## [0.5.12] - 2026-07-13

### Fixed

- **Calendar index reads tolerate permission-hardening failures** —
  `mac-calendar-mcp agenda`, `events`, `search`, and status reads now keep
  working when SQLite opens the index successfully but the surrounding
  execution context rejects the best-effort `chmod(0600)` permission update.
  The Calendar JXA core also tries absolute Calendar.app paths before the
  legacy app-name lookup for contexts where app-name resolution is unreliable.

### Changed

- Bumped both PyPI packages and MCP registry manifests to `0.5.12`.

## [0.5.11] - 2026-07-09

### Fixed

- **Calendar index rebuild failures are now visible and diagnosable** —
  `mac-calendar-mcp index` and `rebuild` now exit non-zero when the rebuilt
  index records failed calendar fetch jobs, preserving the original JXA error
  message, stderr, calendar ID, and calendar name in `failed_index_jobs`.
  Local Calendar store read failures now emit a warning before the JXA fallback
  path, making transient store access issues distinguishable from JXA timeouts.

### Changed

- Bumped both PyPI packages and MCP registry manifests to `0.5.11`.

## [0.5.10] - 2026-06-04

### Fixed

- **Mail JXA now resolves Mail.app by absolute path before name lookup** —
  `Application("Mail")` can fail with `Application can't be found` in some
  shell and Codex execution contexts even when `/System/Applications/Mail.app`
  exists. The Mail JXA core now tries `/System/Applications/Mail.app`,
  `/Applications/Mail.app`, then the legacy `"Mail"` name lookup. This fixes
  commands such as `mac-mail-mcp accounts` in affected contexts.

### Changed

- Bumped both PyPI packages and MCP registry manifests to `0.5.10`.

## [0.5.9] - 2026-06-04

### Changed

- Increased the default `mac-calendar-mcp serve --watch` refresh interval from
  300 seconds to 3600 seconds. Calendar watch mode still performs a startup sync
  and still refreshes when Calendar's local SQLite files change, but the less
  frequent polling reduces background contention with Calendar.app during normal
  use. Use `--watch-interval SECONDS` for faster or slower refreshes.
- Bumped both PyPI packages and MCP registry manifests to `0.5.9`.

### Documentation

- Corrected MCP watch-mode examples to use `serve --watch` command order for
  both Mail and Calendar servers.

## [0.5.8] - 2026-05-31

### Fixed

- **Mail index account scope now accepts friendly account names** — disk
  indexing and `serve --watch` expand `[index] accounts` and
  `[index] exclude_accounts` values from Mail account names to the on-disk
  account UUIDs used under `~/Library/Mail/V*/`. This fixes scoped indexes
  reporting `Indexed 0 emails` when users configured an account name instead
  of a UUID. Unknown values are preserved so direct UUID filters keep working.

### Changed

- Bumped both PyPI packages and MCP registry manifests to `0.5.8`.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-05-28

### Performance

- **`list_accounts()` and `get_emails()` now skip the AppleScript round-trip on the fast path** — both tools previously spawned `osascript` for every call, paying the JXA IPC ceiling (~150ms and ~1.2s respectively on a ~73K-message mailbox). `list_accounts()` now serves from the existing `AccountMap` cache (5-minute TTL) when warm — repeat calls within a session drop from ~150ms to ~1ms. `get_emails()` reads Apple's Envelope Index SQLite directly (the same `~/Library/Mail/V*/MailData/Envelope Index` that BastianZim, rusty, and pl-lyfx query), joining through the `subjects` and `addresses` lookup tables to materialize text columns — every filter (`all`, `unread`, `flagged`, `today`, `last_7_days`, `this_week`) is served from direct integer columns on `messages` without any JXA fallback for live state. Measured 75–250× speedup on a ~73K-message mailbox: list_accounts 153ms→~2ms (warm), get_emails 1247ms→~5ms. Both tools cascade to the existing JXA path automatically if the Envelope Index isn't accessible (schema mismatch, missing file, restrictive permissions), preserving correctness on any Mail.app build. New module `index/envelope_direct.py` with 22 unit tests; `index/accounts.py` gains `reset()` and `get_cached_accounts()` for the cache path and test isolation.

### Added

- **TOML configuration file at `~/.apple-mail-mcp/config.toml`** — every existing `APPLE_MAIL_*` env var now has a sibling key in a structured TOML file. Resolution order is CLI flag > environment variable > file value > built-in default, so existing env-only deployments keep working unchanged. The file is for durable user policy (default account/mailbox, index scope, read-only) that's awkward to maintain across multiple MCP client configs — set it once in `config.toml` instead of pasting the same `env: {}` block into Claude Desktop + Cursor + Cline. Schema is versioned (`config_version = 1`) and validated with file-path context: bad keys, wrong types, negative values, version mismatches, and a subtle bool-in-int-slot trap all fail loud rather than silently degrading. The "empty list = explicit empty, not default" semantics are intentional and tested — `exclude_mailboxes = []` means "no exclusions" rather than falling back to the `{"Drafts"}` default. New `tomllib`-based loader (stdlib in 3.11+) with no added runtime dependency. 33 new tests in `tests/test_config.py` cover the precedence semantics across all four layers.
- **`apple-mail-mcp init` CLI command** — writes a heavily-commented `config.toml` template to `~/.apple-mail-mcp/`. Every available key is documented inline alongside its matching env var; all values are commented out so the template preserves current defaults and users opt in by uncommenting. The file is written with `0o600` permissions, matching the project's existing posture for `index.db` and the attachment cache. `--force` overrides an existing file. A roundtrip test loads the template back through the validator on every run, catching any drift between the schema and the documentation before it reaches a user.
- **Read-only mode is now enforced at MCP tool boundaries (#80)** — `_ensure_writable()` helper in `server.py` raises `PermissionError` when read-only is active (via env, TOML key, or `apple-mail-mcp serve -r`). Future write tools must call this as their first line. An AST-based regression test in `tests/test_server.py` scans `server.py` for `@mcp.tool` functions whose names start with write-implying prefixes (`mark_`, `move_`, `send_`, `reply_`, `forward_`, `delete_`, `create_`, `update_`, `set_`, `archive_`, `trash_`, `flag_`, `unflag_`) and asserts each one calls the guard. Passes vacuously today (no write tools exist), fires the moment a contributor forgets the check on a future write tool. The flag was decorative before; the infrastructure now in place keeps it honest as the write-ops cluster (#22, #23, #24, #64, #65) lands.

### Documentation

- **`docs/configuration.md`** restructured around TOML-first with env vars as overrides. New "Precedence" section documents the CLI > env > file > default order, and the env-var table gains a matching TOML-key column.
- **`CLAUDE.md` Configuration section** updated with the new precedence model, matching TOML key column, empty-list semantics note, and #80 enforcement pointer. `apple-mail-mcp init` added to the CLI Commands list.
- **README** gains a brief "Configure (Optional)" subsection pointing to `apple-mail-mcp init` and the configuration docs.

## [0.3.3] - 2026-05-14

### Fixed

- **External-attachment lookup for nested MIME parts** — Apple Mail stores externally-referenced attachments under `Attachments/<msg_id>/<part>/` where `<part>` is an RFC-style MIME part number. Top-level parts use flat integers (`2/`), but nested parts (common in forwarded emails: `multipart/mixed > multipart/mixed > application/pdf`) use dot notation (`2.2/`, `1.16/`, etc.). The previous implementation tracked a flat attachment counter and routed every lookup to a top-level subdir, so any nested attachment came back as `size: 0` from `parse_emlx()` and `None` from `get_attachment_content()`. New `_mime_part_numbers()` helper walks the MIME tree and builds an `id(part) → "2.2"` map; `_extract_attachments()`, `get_attachment_content()`, and `_find_external_attachment()` now use real part numbers instead of the flat counter. Scoped check against a real ~72K-message mailbox: 4,063 dot-notation subdirs (~18% of all attachments) were affected; flat-attachment behavior is preserved (regression test included). Thanks to @scottwb for the fix and tests. (#85)
- **Hardened `_mime_part_numbers` lookup fallback** — `_extract_attachments` and `get_attachment_content` used `part_numbers.get(id(part), "")` to resolve the MIME part number for the external-attachment subdir lookup. An empty-string fallback would silently collapse the `Path / "<subdir>"` join to the attachments root directory (`Path("/x") / "" == Path("/x")`), potentially returning a wrong file via the single-file-in-dir fallback in `_find_external_attachment`. Both call sites now check for a missing part number explicitly and skip the external lookup rather than misroute. Defensive — doesn't trigger today (the helper covers every leaf part), but locks in the invariant for future refactors. Two new regression tests in `TestMimePartNumbersFallback`.

### Security

- **Attachment cache files are now chmod'd to `0o600`** — `get_email_attachment` and `get_attachment` write extracted attachment content to `~/.apple-mail-mcp/attachments/<random>/<filename>`. The cache directory was already `0o700`, but the file itself inherited the user's umask (typically `0o644`). On single-user installs this is moot, but on shared hosts (CI runners, multi-user dev VMs, lab machines) other local users could read the cached attachment content before the 24-hour cleanup. The file is now explicitly `chmod`'d to `0o600` immediately after write, matching the existing `0o600` posture documented for the index database. New regression test in `TestGetAttachment`. (#79)

### Changed

- **CI workflows opt into Node 24 ahead of the forced cutover** — `lint.yml` and `release.yml` now set `FORCE_JAVASCRIPT_ACTIONS_TO_NODE24: true` at the workflow level. GitHub will force all JavaScript actions to Node 24 by default on June 2nd, 2026, and remove Node 20 from runners on September 16th, 2026. Opting in now silences the deprecation warning that appears on every Actions run today and verifies our pinned action versions (`actions/checkout@v4`, `astral-sh/setup-uv@v5`, `actions/upload-artifact@v4`, `actions/download-artifact@v4`, `pypa/gh-action-pypi-publish@release/v1`) work correctly on the newer runtime well before it becomes mandatory.

## [0.3.2] - 2026-05-10

### Added

- **`--profile PATH` flag on `index` and `rebuild`** — wraps the operation in `cProfile` and writes a `pstats`-format dump to the given path. Stdlib-only (no new runtime dependencies). Intended for users diagnosing slow indexing on their own data and for sharing actionable performance traces in bug reports. Documented in `docs/profiling.md` along with recommended visualizers (`flameprof` for flame charts, `gprof2dot` for call graphs, `snakeviz` for interactive exploration). Surfaced in response to community feedback on #60 — wall-clock invariance at 100k+ mailbox scale was hard to diagnose without a contributor-friendly profiling path. Open follow-up tracked in #84 (sync inventory walk dominates wall-clock at >100k mailboxes) — large-mailbox contributors are explicitly asked to share `--profile` dumps there. `flameprof>=0.4` added to the `dev` dependency group so contributors get a flame-chart renderer on `uv sync`.
- **`docs/profiling.md`** — methodology page covering when to profile, how to capture, how to read the two halves of a flame chart (cumulative vs self-time), and what patterns in a profile signal which optimization strategies. Includes a reference breakdown from a real ~60k-message mailbox showing balanced overhead across the parse pipeline (no single dominant bottleneck on this dataset). Wired into the mkdocs nav.

### Fixed

- **`index://status` resource no longer walks the disk on every call** — `IndexManager.get_stats()` now caches `disk_email_count` with a 60-second TTL via a new `_get_disk_email_count_cached()` helper. Previously, every read of the `index://status` MCP resource triggered a full `get_disk_inventory()` filesystem walk under `~/Library/Mail/V*/`, which is O(N files) and would dominate response latency for clients polling the resource on a tight loop. The cache is automatically invalidated at the end of `build_from_disk()` and `sync_updates()` so the next status call after a sync reflects truth. Failures (`PermissionError`, `FileNotFoundError`) are deliberately *not* cached so subsequent calls retry in case Full Disk Access has since been granted. New public `invalidate_disk_count_cache()` method for callers that need to force a fresh read. (#78)
- **Memory allocation in `_estimate_attachment_size`** — replaced chained `raw.replace("\n", "").replace("\r", "").replace(" ", "")` with `str.count()` (allocation-free) followed by a bounded trailing-padding scan. Verified via `tracemalloc` on a 19.3 MB base64 payload: peak allocation drops from **38.4 MB → 19.3 MB** (2x reduction; new impl peak equals input size, allocating nothing additional). The original issue's "80 MB" estimate assumed all three `.replace()` calls would each allocate a full copy, but CPython short-circuits `str.replace` when no replacements occur — so the realistic peak is 2x not 4x. Still real, still GC-pressure-inducing during bulk indexing of attachment-heavy mailboxes. The fix preserves exact semantics — including the padding subtraction that the originally-proposed Option B (`int(len(raw) * 0.75)`) would have lost — verified by the existing `test_base64_size_estimation` test plus a new whitespace-heavy regression test. (#81)

## [0.3.1] - 2026-05-08

### Changed

- **`APPLE_MAIL_INDEX_MAX_EMAILS` is now uncapped by default** — the per-mailbox ceiling that silently truncated large mailboxes at 5000 messages is gone. The env var still works as an opt-in ceiling for users who want to bound disk/memory usage; setting it to an integer enforces the same per-mailbox limit as before. `get_index_max_emails()` returns `int | None` and all consumers (sync, build_from_disk, get_stats) treat `None` as no cap. The 5000 default predated disk-first sync (when JXA timed out at 60s and 5000 was the realistic indexable count); the bottleneck has long since moved, and the silent default no longer matched the README's "full-coverage body search" claim. Existing indexes built under the old default will *not* automatically backfill older messages — run `apple-mail-mcp rebuild` to re-index without the cap.
- **`apple-mail-mcp status` surfaces capped mailboxes** — when `APPLE_MAIL_INDEX_MAX_EMAILS` is set and any mailbox is at the ceiling, `status` now prints a "Capped: N mailbox(es)" line with a hint to raise or unset the env var. Previously this state was only visible via the `index://status` MCP resource.

### Documentation

- **Removed the "Migrating from apple-mcp?" README section** — the `supermemoryai/apple-mcp` migration table was kept for compatibility framing during the early v0.x cycle. The reference is no longer load-bearing for new users; dropping it tightens the README without losing information that's still findable in v0.3.0 release notes if needed.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-05-07

### Fixed

- **Watcher race during `build_from_disk()`** — in `IndexManager.build_from_disk` the FTS5 sync triggers were dropped for the bulk-insert pass and recreated *after* `rebuild_fts_index()`. Any concurrent INSERT (file watcher, separate process holding `--watch`) that landed between the FTS rebuild and the trigger recreation entered `emails` but never reached `emails_fts`, leaving the row permanently unsearchable. The trigger recreation now happens *before* the FTS rebuild — concurrent inserts during the rebuild fire the recreated trigger, and the rebuild itself re-syncs everything in `emails`, double-covering the window. (Surfaced via Gemini code review.)
- **Stale FTS5 entry auto-cleanup** — when `get_email()` Strategy 0 finds an indexed `.emlx` path that no longer exists on disk (the message was deleted or moved between syncs), the dead row is now removed from the index and a clear `"deleted or moved"` error is returned. Previously the cascade fell through to Strategy 3 and timed out (~1.3% of `get_email` calls in observed traffic). Adds `IndexManager.delete_email()` primitive. (#74)
- **Dead letter queue for `.emlx` parse failures** — files that fail to parse in the watcher or disk-sync paths are now recorded in a new `failed_index_jobs` table (path, account, mailbox, error type/message, first/last seen, attempt count). Previously such failures were swallowed silently after the v0.1.8 watcher hardening. Successful re-parses automatically clear the entry. Surfaced in `apple-mail-mcp status` and the `index://status` resource via a new `failed_jobs_count`. Schema bumped to v5 with a forward-only migration. (#58)
- **DLQ write failures now log at ERROR level** — when the `failed_index_jobs` INSERT itself fails (disk full, DB corruption, schema mismatch), both the watcher and disk-sync paths now log at ERROR with diagnostic context instead of swallowing silently (sync) or emitting WARNING (watcher). Surfaces operationally-significant failure modes that were previously invisible. (#77)

### Changed

- **`cyclopts` constraint relaxed to stable** — was `>=5.0.0a1` (pre-release), now `>=4.10`. Removes the need for `--prerelease=allow` in `claude_desktop_config.json` and other install configs. No API changes; the cyclopts surface used by `cli.py` is identical between 4.x and 5.x. (#75)
- **HTML stripping during indexing now uses selectolax** (lexbor C parser) for ~5x faster `_strip_html()` on realistic email HTML (5-25 KB body parts). BeautifulSoup is kept as a fallback if selectolax raises or fails to import. All existing XSS-bypass tests pass under both paths. New `selectolax>=0.4.8` dependency. (#59)
- **`sync_from_disk()` now uses a SQL temp table for diffing** instead of materializing the full disk and DB inventories as Python dicts. Memory at sync time stays flat (~2-3 MB delta) regardless of mailbox size; previously the dicts grew linearly to ~116 MB at 200K emails. Time cost is ~1.8x (sub-second even at 200K). Adds `iter_disk_inventory()` streaming variant of `get_disk_inventory()` in `disk.py`. All existing sync tests pass — behavior is preserved (added/deleted/moved counts, mtime sort, per-mailbox cap). (#60)

### Added

- **`index://status` MCP resource** — read-only JSON snapshot of the FTS5 search index (counts, size, last sync, staleness). Lets MCP clients assess index health without invoking a tool. (#12)
- **Benchmark suite expansion + refresh** — added `sweetrb/apple-mail-mcp` (TypeScript, AppleScript-based, 40+ tools, npm) and `BastianZim/apple-mail-mcp` (Python, reads Envelope Index SQLite + `.emlx` directly, no AppleScript) to the competitor list, then re-ran the full sweep on a 72K-message mailbox. Charts and the benchmarks doc are refreshed; positioning copy updated to reflect that the FTS5 differentiator is now precisely "full-coverage body search" — BastianZim implements a body parameter but caps live-scanning at the 5000 most recent messages (silent miss on older mail). Per-scenario charts now mark BastianZim as "5K cap" in the capability matrix and exclude it from the body-search bar chart so the comparison stays apples-to-apples.
- **`server.json` declares `runtimeHint: "uvx"`** — spec-compliant signal to MCP registries that the canonical launch command is `uvx apple-mail-mcp`. No effect on existing clients that already invoke the package directly.

### Documentation

- **Discovery descriptions refreshed** — `pyproject.toml`, `server.json`, and `mkdocs.yml` all now describe the project as "Apple Mail MCP server with full-coverage FTS5 body search. Reliable on large mailboxes where AppleScript-based servers timeout." Replaces the older "the only one that works reliably" wording, which the v0.3.0 bench refresh showed was no longer uniquely ours (BastianZim also handles large mailboxes — just with a 5000-message body-search cap).
- **Schema-version references updated to v5** across `CLAUDE.md`, `docs/architecture.md`, and `docs/search.md`.
- **New documentation sections** for the `index://status` MCP resource (`CLAUDE.md`, `docs/architecture.md`, `docs/tools.md`) and the `failed_index_jobs` DLQ (`docs/search.md`, `docs/troubleshooting.md`).

## [0.2.2] - 2026-04-13

### Added

- **Mailbox name alias resolution** — JXA `getMailbox()` now resolves common cross-provider aliases (e.g., `Sent Messages` → `Sent Items` on Outlook, `Trash` → `Deleted Items`) and falls back to case-insensitive matching. (#73)
- **Configurable Strategy 3 timeout** — Strategy 3 (iterate-all-mailboxes fallback in `get_email`) now exposes `APPLE_MAIL_STRATEGY3_TIMEOUT` and `APPLE_MAIL_STRATEGY3_MAX_MAILBOXES` environment variables.

### Fixed

- **Bare wildcard `*` query** — no longer crashes FTS5 with a syntax error. (#72)

### Tests

- Added watcher tests for noisy events, nested mbox, V11 directory layouts, and pending-changes limits.
- Added corrupt `.emlx` parser tests (bad byte counts, truncated content, empty files, missing newline). +10 tests; total 325 passing.

## [0.2.1] - 2026-04-05

### Added

- **Search pagination** — new `offset` parameter on `search()` for paginated results. Use with `limit` to page through large result sets. (#8)
- **Status command completeness** — `apple-mail-mcp status` now reports attachment count, disk email count, and index coverage percentage. (#43)

### Changed

- **Strategy 3 JXA moved to builders.py** — the inline JXA script for iterating all mailboxes is now a `GetEmailBuilder` class, consistent with the existing builder pattern. (#56)

### Fixed

- **Case-insensitive attachment filename matching** — `get_email_attachment` now matches filenames regardless of case or whitespace, fixing failures when LLM clients re-serialize filenames with minor differences. (#71)

## [0.2.0] - 2026-04-01

### Added

- **Date-range filtering for search** — new `before` and `after` parameters (YYYY-MM-DD) on `search()`. Filter results by date across all scopes including attachments. (#9)
- **Highlighted search results** — new `highlight` parameter on `search()`. When enabled, matched terms are wrapped in `**markers**` in subject and content_snippet using FTS5 `highlight()` and `snippet()`. (#11)
- **`get_email_links()` tool** — extracts hyperlinks from an email's HTML content. Replaces the links mode of `get_attachment()`. (#55)
- **`get_email_attachment()` tool** — extracts a named file attachment and saves to disk. Replaces the attachment mode of `get_attachment()`. (#55)
- **CLI wrappers** — all MCP tools now accessible as CLI commands: `search`, `read`, `emails`, `accounts`, `mailboxes`, `extract`. Output JSON to stdout. (#61)
- **Skill generator** — `apple-mail-mcp integrate claude` generates a Claude Code skill file for CLI-based email access. (#62)
- **`--read-only` server flag** — `apple-mail-mcp serve --read-only` (or `APPLE_MAIL_READ_ONLY=true`) prepares for v0.3.0 write operations. (#63)
- **Dynamic Mail version detection** — auto-detects the highest `V*` directory under `~/Library/Mail/` instead of hardcoding `V10`. (#57)

### Changed

- **`get_attachment()` deprecated** — still registered for backwards compatibility, but delegates to `get_email_links()` or `get_email_attachment()`. Will be removed in v0.3.0.

### Fixed (from v0.1.8)

- **Watcher crash on file add** — `parse_emlx()` exceptions beyond `OSError`/`ValueError`/`UnicodeDecodeError` (e.g. malformed plist, missing headers) no longer kill the watcher thread. The watcher now skips unparseable files and continues processing.
- **Attachment cache leak** — `_cleanup_old_attachments()` is now called automatically when extracting attachments, preventing unbounded disk usage from cached files.
- **Attachment cache permissions** — cache directory is now created with `0o700` permissions to protect sensitive email attachment content.
- **Empty search error messages** — search index errors (corrupt DB, SQLite issues) now return actionable error messages instead of empty strings. Suggests `apple-mail-mcp rebuild` when the index is broken.
- **Misleading get_email timeout message** — when `get_email` times out, the error now checks whether account/mailbox were already provided and gives context-appropriate advice instead of always saying "Provide account/mailbox".
- **Renamed `this_week` filter to `last_7_days`** — `this_week` kept as alias for backwards compatibility. (#49)
- **`search_fts_highlight()` bugs** — fixed missing account/mailbox/exclude_mailboxes filters, integer row indexing, and missing FTS5 retry logic.
- **Case-sensitive mailbox filtering** — `search(mailbox="INBOX")` now matches `Inbox`, `inbox`, etc. Previously returned zero results on case mismatch. (#67)
- **Updated patrickfreyer benchmark config** and added `rusty_apple_mail_mcp` to benchmarks.

## [0.1.7] - 2026-03-11

### Added

- **Strategy 0 (disk read) for `get_email()`** — reads email content directly from `.emlx` files on disk, bypassing JXA/Apple Events entirely. Fastest path when the search index is available. Falls through to JXA strategies on failure. (Thanks to @vkostakos for the initial implementation in PR #53)
- Extracts read/flagged status from `.emlx` plist footer flags bitmask
- Extracts `date_sent`, `reply_to`, `Message-ID` from MIME headers for full schema parity
- `get_email` benchmark scenario with dynamic message ID discovery
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` for new contributors
- This changelog

### Fixed

- `date_received` now uses the `Received` header (delivery time) instead of `Date` header (composition time). Previously both `date_received` and `date_sent` were identical. Run `apple-mail-mcp rebuild` after upgrading to fix historical emails.

### Changed
